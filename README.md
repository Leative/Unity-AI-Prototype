## Prototype of a simple AI
Idea: a humanoid character can identify obstacles near its location and cover behind them to fight another character.

This is a simple prototype to exercise working with various aspects of creating an AI:
- Humanoid models
- Animation, Rigging
- Animation events, triggered sounds
- Statemachine as character controller
- NavMesh
- Raycasting
- Calculating viable cover instead of using pre-defined positions
- Self-loading singleton to add debugging gizmos
